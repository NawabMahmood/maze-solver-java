# maze-solver-java
This project implements a maze solver in Java using multiple search methods (stack, queue, recursive). It reads a 2D maze from a file, validates and represents it with custom square types, and finds an exit using DFS, BFS, or recursion. The simulation provides visual feedback and robust error handling.
